# genesis
My first repository is a place to variably learn organically, compiling my first programming projects, and learning GitHub.
Through various means and methodologies, I'd like to retrace the annuls of history and computational thought that I might better understand the theories and evolution of computational innovation and it's subsequent devolution or degensis of society.
